# VSCode PHPStorm Formatter extension

I developed this extension as a tool to use in my work to bypass using PHPStorm directly in order to maintain the organization code styles.

# How to run

1. Set the configuration variable `phpstorm-formatter.phpstormBinDir` with the _path_ to your PHPStorm bin directory.
2. `Ctrl+p` to execute command in VSCode and select `Format PHP File`.
